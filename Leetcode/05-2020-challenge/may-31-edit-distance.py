  Edit Distance
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        if len(word1) > len(word2):
            word1, word2 = word2, word1

        distances = range(len(word1) + 1)
        for i2, c2 in enumerate(word2):
            distances_ = [i2+1]
            for i1, c1 in enumerate(word1):
                if c1 == c2:
                    distances_.append(distances[i1])
                else:
                    distances_.append(1 + min((distances[i1], distances[i1 + 1], distances_[-1])))
            distances = distances_
        return distances[-1]
